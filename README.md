## CppPatientDataManager

This C++ program is designed to store, analyze, and display patient information in a structured format.  
It uses **structures (`struct`)** to group related data such as first name, last name, date of birth, age, gender, and blood sugar level.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Input:** Reads information for multiple patients, including personal and medical details.
- **Find Youngest Patient:** Determines and displays the patient with the lowest age.
- **Gender Count:** Counts and displays the total number of men and women.
- **Health Analysis:**
  - Counts patients with a blood sugar level greater than 100.
  - Counts patients whose first name length exceeds 10 characters.
- **Year-based Filtering:** Displays all patients born in the year 1380 (Hijri Shamsi calendar).
- **Complete List Output:** Prints all stored patient records in a formatted way.

This program is a practical example of working with **arrays of structures, string handling, and conditional logic** in C++.  
It can be expanded into a more advanced hospital or clinic management system.
